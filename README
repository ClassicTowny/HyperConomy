HyperConomy is the all in one economy plugin. Currently it supports visual chest shops for player to player trading, sign based shops for player to server trading, and easy to use command based shops for player to server trading. HyperConomy includes an integrated web page which can display all of your item and enchantment prices. Additionally, HyperConomy can operate using MySQL, allowing easy manipulation of data. It even includes item displays which allow for shops very similar to Showcase and ShowcaseStandalone, except even more versatile. In the future HyperConomy will include its own economy plugin, as well as a standalone PHP web page which will display item prices and information. If you're running Tekkit, HyperConomy supports that as well; it should allow the addition of an unlimited number of custom items to the shop, allowing Tekkit servers to trade custom items.
